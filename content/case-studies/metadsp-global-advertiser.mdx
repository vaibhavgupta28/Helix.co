## The Problem

Our client, a global retail advertiser spending $50M+ annually across programmatic channels, was struggling with fragmented campaign management. They operated across five major DSPs (Google DV360, The Trade Desk, Amazon DSP, Xandr, and a proprietary solution), each with its own interface, bidding logic, and reporting system.

Key pain points included:

- **No unified view** of performance across platforms
- **Manual budget reallocation** leading to delayed optimizations
- **Inconsistent audience targeting** across DSPs
- **Duplicated spend** due to lack of cross-platform deduplication
- **Siloed teams** managing different platforms

## Our Solution

We designed and built a custom **MetaDSP platform** that unified their multi-DSP operations under a single AI-powered control plane.

### Architecture Highlights

- **Unified Data Layer**: Consolidated impression, click, and conversion data from all five DSPs into a centralized data warehouse (Google BigQuery)
- **AI Optimization Engine**: Proprietary ML models trained on historical spend data to predict optimal budget allocation across DSPs
- **Real-Time Bidding Orchestration**: Intelligent bid adjustments across platforms based on cross-DSP performance signals
- **Audience Sync**: Unified audience segmentation synced to all connected DSPs in near real-time
- **Custom Dashboard**: Single-pane-of-glass reporting with drill-down capabilities per DSP, campaign, and creative

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (ML), PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Data Pipeline**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Google BigQuery
- **ML/AI**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, D3.js for visualizations
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes on GCP, Terraform for IaC

## Results

Within 90 days of launch, the client saw transformational improvements:

- **30% reduction in wasted spend** by eliminating cross-DSP duplication and reallocating budgets to top-performing channels
- **45% increase in campaign ROI** through AI-driven bid optimization and audience intelligence
- **60% reduction in operational overhead** as manual tasks were automated
- **Sub-100ms latency** for bid decisions across all DSPs
- **99.9% platform uptime** across 20+ global markets

## Client Testimonial

> "Helix didn't just build us a tool — they built us a competitive advantage. The MetaDSP has transformed how we buy media, and the results speak for themselves."
> **— VP of Media, Global Retail Advertiser**

## Key Takeaways

- **Unified platforms drive efficiency**: Consolidating multi-DSP operations unlocks hidden waste and optimization opportunities.
- **AI scales human expertise**: Our ML models made millions of micro-decisions per day that would be impossible manually.
- **Speed matters**: Real-time data pipelines and sub-100ms bid decisions gave the client a competitive edge in auctions.
