client: "Regional Publisher Consortium"
industry: "Publishing / Media"
challenge: "A consortium of 15 regional publishers needed a unified SSP to increase yield, reduce reliance on major exchanges, and maintain control over their inventory."
results:
  - "Increased eCPM by 22% through optimized auction logic"
  - "Reduced revenue share to exchanges by 40%"
  - "Achieved 500ms average bid response time"

## The Problem

A consortium of 15 mid-sized regional news publishers was losing revenue to intermediaries and lacked control over their programmatic inventory. Their challenges included:

- **High exchange fees**: Paying 15-20% revenue share to major SSPs
- **Opaque auction dynamics**: No visibility into how their inventory was being monetized
- **Weak yield optimization**: Limited control over floor prices and bid filtering
- **Slow innovation**: Dependent on SSP roadmaps for new features
- **Data leakage**: First-party audience data shared with third-party platforms

They wanted to build their own **Supply-Side Platform (SSP)** to take back control, but lacked the in-house expertise.

## Our Solution

We designed and built a **custom SSP** tailored to their consortium's needs, with a focus on yield optimization, transparency, and speed.

### Core Capabilities

**Real-Time Bidding (RTB) Engine**
- **Header bidding support**: Server-to-server and client-side wrappers
- **Unified auction**: Combined direct deals, PMPs, and open exchange demand
- **Smart floor pricing**: ML-driven price floors based on historical performance
- **Bid filtering**: Block low-quality demand and optimize for eCPM

**Demand Integration**
- **Pre-built adapters** for 12 major DSPs and ad exchanges
- **Direct deals management**: UI for setting up and managing PMPs
- **Demand quality scoring**: Automatic ranking of demand sources by fill rate and eCPM

**Yield Optimization**
- **A/B testing framework**: Test different auction configurations
- **Dynamic timeouts**: Adjust bid timeouts based on demand partner latency
- **Inventory segmentation**: Different auction rules for premium vs. remnant inventory

**Analytics & Reporting**
- **Real-time dashboards**: Monitor fill rates, eCPM, and latency
- **Demand partner scorecards**: Compare performance across DSPs
- **Revenue attribution**: Understand which demand sources drive the most value

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (for low-latency RTB), Node.js (for APIs)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB (time-series data)
- **Cache**: Redis (for bid caching and rate limiting)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (for async event processing)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (EC2, ALB, RDS), Docker, Kubernetes
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Tailwind CSS

## Architecture Highlights

Our SSP architecture prioritized **speed** and **scalability**:

- **Edge deployment**: Bid servers deployed in 5 AWS regions for low latency
- **Horizontal scaling**: Auto-scaling based on request volume
- **Efficient bid routing**: Request deduplication and intelligent demand partner selection
- **Failover logic**: Automatic fallback to backup demand partners

## Results

Within the first 6 months, the publishers saw dramatic improvements:

- **22% increase in eCPM** through optimized auction logic and better demand curation
- **40% reduction in revenue share** by cutting out intermediary SSPs
- **500ms average bid response time** across all demand partners
- **5B+ monthly impressions** processed with 99.95% uptime
- **Full transparency**: Publishers could see exactly which demand partners won and at what price

## Economic Impact

The consortium estimated **$2.4M in additional annual revenue** from the combination of higher eCPMs and reduced fees. The platform paid for itself in under 6 months.

## Client Testimonial

> "Helix gave us what we couldn't get from the big SSPs: control, transparency, and economics that actually work for publishers. This platform has been a game-changer for our consortium."
> **â€” CEO, Regional Publisher Consortium**

## Key Takeaways

- **Ownership matters**: Publishers who control their tech stack can optimize for their own economics, not someone else's.
- **Speed wins auctions**: Sub-500ms response times meant more bid opportunities and higher fill rates.
- **Transparency builds trust**: Giving publishers full visibility into auction dynamics increased their confidence and engagement.
